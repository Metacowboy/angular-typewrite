AngularJS-Typewrite
===================

## Description
AngularJS directive that simulates the effect of typing on a text editor - with a blinking cursor.

This directive works as an attribute to any HTML element, and it lets customize the speed/delay of its animations.


##How to use:

Just add the desired text to the 'text' attribute of the element and the directive takes care of the rest.

##How to use:

* initial delay: add an 'initial-delay' property to the element 
* typing speed: add an 'typing-delay' property to the element
* cursor blinking speed: add an 'blink-delay' property to the element

##Dependencies
This directives only depends on the CSS file provided (typewriter-styles.css) in order to replicate the cursor blinking effect.

## Demo

I created a (Codepen Demo)[http://codepen.io/capelo/pen/Bmbgn] to show the directive working with different setups.
